# Travel Destinations

A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit.

This project is a part of the tutorial to learn how to add files from terminal to github. Udacity explains basic command usage in the best possible way so that anyone (like me), who did not know how to code, is able to code in just few weeks. 

# Steps

1. Fork the repository of the project from udacity
2. Clone the repository to your terminal using the URL so that you can work locally on terminal and then commit your changes to remote repository.
3. Use basic workflow (i.e., `Git add .` , `Git commit` , `Git push` etc,) as per the instructions.


# Suggestion
Try to keep using `Git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all` to see your progress of branching
